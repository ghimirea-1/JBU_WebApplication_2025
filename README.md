# JBU_WebApplication_2025
events planner and organizer

### **Step 1: Explain Work Division Simply**  
Tell Miriam:  
- "I'll handle the **backend** (database, system logic, and Club Events module)."  
- "You handle the **frontend** (UI design, Party Events module, and documentation)."  
- "We’ll both connect the frontend and backend, test, and refine everything together."  

### **Step 2: Work Plan for Each Preview Day**  

#### **Preview 1 – February 18 (Basic Setup & UI)**  
✅ Set up project structure (folder organization, frameworks, tools)  
✅ Create a simple UI layout (buttons, forms, navigation)  
✅ Plan database structure and event details  

#### **Preview 2 – March 18 (Core Features Working)**  
✅ Backend should handle event creation, storage, and retrieval  
✅ Frontend should display events and let users add details  
✅ Connect frontend and backend for basic functionality  

#### **Preview 3 – April 29 (Final Version Ready)**  
✅ Complete debugging, improve UI, and optimize features  
✅ Add extra features (if time allows)  
✅ Final testing and polish everything for presentation  

### **Final Presentation – May 5 (Backup Time)**  
- Use this as a buffer if anything needs last-minute fixes  

### **Step 3: Divide the Work Each Week**  
- Work together on setup in **Week 1**  
- Assign specific coding tasks weekly, so neither of you gets overloaded  
- Hold quick check-ins (e.g., twice a week) to stay on track
