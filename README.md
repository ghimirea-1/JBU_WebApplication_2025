events planner and organizer

### Step 1: Explain Work Division Simply
Tell Miriam:  
- "I'll handle the **backend** (database, system logic, and Club Events module)."  
- "You handle the **frontend** (UI design, Party Events module, and documentation)."  
- "We‚Äôll both connect the frontend and backend, test, and refine everything together."  

### **Step 2: Work Plan for Each Preview Day**  

#### **Preview 1 ‚Äì February 18 (Basic Setup & UI)**  
‚úÖ Set up project structure (folder organization, frameworks, tools)  
‚úÖ Create a simple UI layout (buttons, forms, navigation)  
‚úÖ Plan database structure and event details  

If your project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it will look like a structured and interactive event planning dashboard. Here's a basic breakdown of how it could be designed:

---

### **üìå Project Layout in HTML/CSS/JS**
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Home Page (Dashboard)**
- A **navigation bar** with links to different event categories (Party Events, Club Events, Settings).
- A **welcome section** introducing the event manager.
- Buttons to create, edit, or view events.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Event Creation Page (For Both Party & Club Events)**
- **Form with input fields**:
  - Event Name
  - Event Type (Dropdown: Birthday, Farewell, Club Event, etc.)
  - Date Picker
  - Expense & Funding Fields
  - Venue Selection
  - Duration Slider
- **Submit Button** to save event details (can be stored in localStorage or a database).

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Event List Page**
- A **table or card-based layout** displaying upcoming and past events.
- **Filters** to sort by date, type, or budget.
- **Edit/Delete options** for each event.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Event Details Page**
- Clicking on an event opens a detailed **view with all event information**.
- Option to **edit details** or **mark the event as completed**.

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Responsiveness & Styling**
- Use **CSS for styling** (modern, clean UI with good colors and typography).
- Make it **mobile-friendly** using flexbox or grid.
- Add **animations** (hover effects, transitions for a smooth UI).

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript for Interactivity**
- **Form validation** before submission.
- **Dynamic UI updates** when adding/editing events.
- **Storage** (localStorage, Firebase, or a simple database).
- **Event countdown/timer feature** for upcoming events.

#### **Preview 2 ‚Äì March 18 (Core Features Working)**  
‚úÖ Backend should handle event creation, storage, and retrieval  
‚úÖ Frontend should display events and let users add details  
‚úÖ Connect frontend and backend for basic functionality  

#### **Preview 3 ‚Äì April 29 (Final Version Ready)**  
‚úÖ Complete debugging, improve UI, and optimize features  
‚úÖ Add extra features (if time allows)  
‚úÖ Final testing and polish everything for presentation  

### **Final Presentation ‚Äì May 5 (Backup Time)**  
- Use this as a buffer if anything needs last-minute fixes  

### **Step 3: Divide the Work Each Week**  
- Work together on setup in **Week 1**  
- Assign specific coding tasks weekly, so neither of you gets overloaded  
- Hold quick check-ins (e.g., twice a week) to stay on track
